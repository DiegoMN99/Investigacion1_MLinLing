# Investigacion1_MLinLing
First research project for "ML in Linguistics" course at Universidad de Costa Rica's Master's in Linguistics program

This code is intended to:
  1. Format and normalize internet-gathered text into a more-easily-manipulable text file through the "text_tokenizer.py"
  2. Create excel sheets for manual annotation through "excel_generator.py"
  3. Analyze and manipulate excel and txt data, including Markov Chains and transition probabilities in "excel_analyzer.py"
